This repository provides data and Python notebooks required to reproduce the results of the paper **Genuine Continuous Quantumness** by Vojtěch Kala, Jiří Fadrný, Michal Neset, Jan Bílek, Petr Marek, and Miroslav Ježek. The paper is available on [arXiv:2503.07574](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07574).

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure1.ipynb" contains Python definitions necessary to generate and plot the cost functions as shown in Figure 1 of the manuscript.

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure3.ipynb" contains the definition of a function computing the Wigner function of the quantum state and plotting it. The quantum states plotted in Figure 3 of the manuscript are stored in "Git_figure3_spacs_data.npy" and "Git_figure3_tpacs_data.npy" files.

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure4.ipynb" contains the experimentally determined values of the cubic nonlinear squeezing together with functions that evaluate the cubic nonlinear squeezing of pure theoretical photon-added coherent states, which are required to reproduce Figure 4 of the manuscript.

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure5.ipynb" contains the experimentally determined values of the cubic and quintic nonlinear squeezing together with functions that evaluate the cubic and quintic nonlinear squeezing of pure theoretical photon-added coherent states, which are required to reproduce Figure 5 of the manuscript.

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure6.ipynb" contains Python definitions necessary to reproduce Figure 6 of the manuscript.
